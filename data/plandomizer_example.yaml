# Example Plandomizer file.

# Plandomizer files allow you to control certain aspects when generating a new
# randomizer seed. You can place items in specific locations, and connect
# specific entrances if entrance randomizer is enabled.

# All plandomized elements must be under a "World 1" element at the start of the
# plandomizer file like this
World 1:
      # ...everything else...

# LOCATIONS
# All plandomized locations are defined under a "locations" element and consist
# of the location name followed by a colon(:) and the item name you want placed
# at that location. The following example places Clawshots at Knight Academy - Fledge's Gift
# and Amber Tablet at Earth Temple - Boss Key Chest.
World 1:
  locations:
    Knight Academy - Fledge's Gift: Clawshots
    Earth Temple - Boss Key Chest: Amber Tablet

# NAMES
# As a general rule, capitalize the first letter of all item names except for
# the words "to" and "of". "Bomb Bag" is okay. "bomb bag" will be
# unrecognized. For a full list of location names, please check out:
# https://github.com/mint-choc-chip-skyblade/sshd-rando/blob/main/data/locations.yaml
# or refer to a spoiler log.

# EXCLUDED_LOCATIONS
# Attempting to place a major item in an excluded location will give you a
# Plandomizer Error and the seed won't generate.

# MULTIWORLD PLANDOMIZER (Note: currently multiworld is not an option in the randomizer
# and is not actively being developed, but the filling algorithm was made to support
# multiworld incase it ever happens in the future.)
# If you'd like to plandomize a multiworld seed, then each element
# must be under a "World #" element, with the '#' being the world number
# the locations will be for. For example, if we want place the Whip at
# Bazaar - Potion Lady's Gift in World 1 and the Skyview Boss Key at
# Sandship - Bow Chest in World 2, then we'd type
World 1:
  locations:
    Bazaar - Potion Lady's Gift: Whip
World 2:
  locations:
    Sandship - Bow Chest: Skyview Boss Key
# Using this format, the item being plandomized will be for the world that the
# location is currently under. If we want to specify the item for a different
# world we can use the "item" and "world" elements to do so. For example, if we want
# to place the Bomb Bag for World 1 at World 2's Thunderhead East Island - Goddess Chest Chest
# and the Hylian Shield for World 1 at World 2's Eldin Volcano - Chest behind Bombable Wall near Volcano Ascent
# we would type:
World 2:
  locations:
    Thunderhead East Island - Goddess Chest:
      item: Bomb Bag
      world: 1
    Eldin Volcano - Chest behind Bombable Wall near Volcano Ascent:
      item: Hylian Shield
      world: 1
