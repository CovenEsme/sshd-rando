# The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD Randomizer

## Differences from SDR

### New stuff
* Entrance Randomizer with individual options to control randomized entrance types, entrance
coupling, mixing pools
* There is an option to randomize the freestanding crystals into the pool and make their vanilla
locations into randomized checks
* There are new options for controlling how keys and maps are randomized
  * The "Own Region" option will force keys and maps to spawn either in their dungeon or in the
  area it is connected to
  * The "Removed" option will remove keys from the item pool and unlock all key-locked doors
* There is an option to turn on and off cryptic hints
* Adds cryptic hints for items
* There is a setting to control how the ammo pots near bird statues spawn
* Several small event cutscenes have been removed (e.g. pushing logs, freeing ropes)

### Changes
* Required dungeons aren't based on striking the Goddess Crest at the end (or running out the end
entrance of LMF). Required dungeons are only required due to the items placed on their final check
* You need the Goddess's Harp *and* Ballad of the Goddess to raise the Gate of Time
* Hints are controlled by individual options
* You must climb onto Bucha's back to get the `Faron Woods - Kikwi Elder Reward` check
* `Knight Academy - Item from Cawlin` does not require talking to the Toilet Hand or the Goddess's
Harp
* You no longer need to beat Moldarach 2 in Shipyard to play the rickety coaster minigame
* You can call Fi while on fire
* Freestanding item models should all rest on the ground correctly without clipping into the floor
* Speech bubbles will always and only appear above an NPC's head when they have some important
information related to the randomizer (usually checks)

* Flooded Faron Woods randomization
* Heart containers as checks
* Isle of Songs crest as checks
