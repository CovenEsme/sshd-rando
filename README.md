## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What are all these acronyms about (SSR, SSHDR, SDR, HDR)?

Broadly, these are all different terms for the 2 randomizers for Skyward Sword:

* SSR = Skyward Sword Randomizer. This usually refers to the randomizer for the Wii version of the
game.
* SSHDR = Skyward Sword HD Randomizer. This is us! The randomizer for the Switch version of the
game.
* SDR = Standard Definition (SD) Randomizer. This refers to the randomizer for the Wii (or "SD")
version of the game.
* HDR = High Definition (HD) Randomizer. This refers to the randomizer for the Switch (or "HD")
version of the game.

### What is different from the Wii version (SDR)?

In short, a lot ^^'

Due to the better hardware that the Nintendo Switch has, we have been able to add a lot of
features that can't be easily achieved in the Wii version. There are also other changes that we
have made because the decisions made by the SDR devs (some of us are *also* devs there) don't work
as well when applied to HDR.
